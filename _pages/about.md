## Welcome to my blog

Hello! I'm Ryan, but I'm better known online as IntelCorgi. I'm an experienced cyber threat intelligence professional with a passion for OSINT and malware reverse engineering. I decided to create this blog to share some research projects as I continue down my threat intelligence journey. I hope you find it valuable and enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy working on it.
