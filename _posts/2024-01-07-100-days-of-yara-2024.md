## Introduction

Happy New Year and welcome to the most wonderful time of the year: **100 Days of YARA!** Any explanation for my rules will be shared within this blog post to keep things organized.  I'll be storing my rules for this year in this [Github repo.](https://github.com/IntelCorgi/2024) I know already I won't be hitting all 100 days, but will share something whenever I can. 

Check out the following if you're new to 100 Days of YARA
- [#100DaysOfYara](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfYARA&src=typed_query&f=live) hashtag on Twitter - see the awesome research other participants are sharing
- [100 Days of YARA Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UAkkWAQ5) - connect with other participants, share and get feedback on your rules.

## Day 1: Getting Started

Like many New Years resolutions, my plan for 100 Days of YARA hit some turbulence in the first week. I wanted to get this blog up with my first rule on 01 January, but... didn't really have time during the week. Oops. So let's get back on track. 

For Day 1, I just wanted to get this blog stood up. I've been wanting to create a blog using Github pages for a while now to share research, IOCs, etc. and the 100 days of YARA challenge seemed like a perfect opportunity. It was important to me that the platform I blog on be easy to get going so I can spend my time actually researching and writing instead of worrying about configuration all day, hence the decision to go with Github pages (also IMO Medium has been going downhill for a while). 

### Tasks Completed:
- [X] Github pages stood up. IntelCorgi.github.io
- [x] Malware analysis lab created
- [x] Find old rule to update for Day 7
- [x] Brainstorm ideas for other rules

All objectives for Day 1 have been accomplished! I am ready now to actually dive into a YARA rule and will be "starting" at Day 7.
## Day 7: Updating an Old Rule
Since today is the first day I am posting and am also sharing day 1, I decided to simply update an old rule I developed a few years ago. The inspiration for this rule came from seeing so many malware campaigns where an early stage in the infection chain ends up reaching out to a CDN like Discord to grab a follow-on payload. I intend for this rule to be not some sort of "yes this rule is definitely bad 100%" but rather for an analyst to zoom in on a file that has suspicious behavior.

My initial rule had eight CDNs / fileshare sites. While doing some quick research to see if there were any additions I wanted to add, I came across the [Q1 2023 Cloud and Threat Report from Netskope](https://www.netskope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cloud-and-threat-report-global-cloud-and-web-malware-trends.pdf).  The research team at Netskope included a chart showing the top applications where malware was downloaded from.

A few of these applications were already accounted for in the rules, but now I have some more to look up and add the endpoints for. To find endpoints commonly used by malware campaigns that exploit these services, I used [URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/browse/).
- Sharepoint
	- my.sharepoint[.]com/:u:/
- AWS S3
	- s3.amazonaws[.]com/
- Github
	- github[.]com/
	- raw.githubusercontent[.]com/
	- gist.githubusercontent[.]com/
- Weebly
	- weebly[.]com/uploads
- Dropbox
	- dropbox[.]com/scl/fi
- Google Drive
	- drive.google[.]com/uc?export=download&id=
	- drive.google[.]com/file/d/
	- drive.google[.]com/u/0/
- Box
	- box[.]com/s/
	- box[.]com/file/
	- box[.]com/shared/
- Gmail
	- Same as google drive afaik
- Azure Blob Storage
	- blob.core.windows[.]net/

Finally, here is the finished product! Please feel free to send me a message if you have any feedback.
